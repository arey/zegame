Description
-----------
Thanks for downloading our sources ! I've spent a lot of time into
developing ZeGame, and hope that it can give you some piece of 
advice.

You can find in this package the C++ classes of the following
modules :

Requires
--------
 - DirectX 8 or better
 - Microsoft Visual C+ 6
 - ZeGame resources file


Install
-------
Extract the rar in any folder you want. You can compile the 
exceutable file. To run it you have copy all the resources
file of ZeGame in a ZeGame\ sub-directory of where you just 
installed it : either the .zgp files or the files include in
"ZeGame-Res-v1.70.rar".

Make sure that you have the DirectX 8 SDK on your computer.
I used Visual C++ 6.0 for this project and was unable to test the 
Workspace and Project with earlier versions.

If you get compiler errors, make sure that you have your Directories set
in Devstudio to find the correct DX6 files ( or that you physically 
placed them in your Compiler's include and library directories ).  
( in Visual C++ 6.0 ) 
Tools\Options\Directories\ Show directories for:
	Include files
	Library	files 
If they aren't there, go to the bottom of the list (where the empty box is)
Click in the empty box, then click the "..." button and find the directory
that is appropriate.  Include files could be in "c:\DX8SDK\include" as an 
example. 
After you select the correct folder, Use the Up arrow to move that folder
up to the top of the list.
