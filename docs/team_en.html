  Rey&nbsp;</b> 
<p>He's a 3rd year student in the computer science department of the National 
  Institute of Applied Science in Lyon. He is mad about computer programming and 
  more particulary in video game development. A few years ago he alredy has done 
  a set of little games and demos. Since 2 years now he's developing ZeGame in 
  its spare time.
<p>Principal coder, he has realized not only the main motor of the game, but also 
  all the necessary tools that allow to create the level maps and to edit animations 
  of the characters. He uses <i>C<sup>++</sup> Builder</i> from Inprise and <i>Visual 
  C<sup>++</sup> 6</i> from Microsoft as coding tools. More he also uses Pro Motion 
  4 and Sound Forge 4.5 to work with digital sounds and pictures.

  Mouclier</b>
<p>Illustrator of comics : <i>Semio</i> or <i>Dragons</i> (at Delcourt editions), 
  outstanding and talented infographist, he works at the present time for Infogrames 
  since already one year, in their <i>Techlab</i> laboratory.
<p>All the graphims you can see in the game are from him : animations, textures, 
  logos, ... It made it on software as 3D studio Max, Photoshop or the less knowm
